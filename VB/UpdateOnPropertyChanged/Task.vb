' Developer Express Code Central Example:
' How to make GridControl immediately save changes in a cell after editing
' 
' This example shows how to update GridControl's data source right after a cell
' editor value has been changed. To implement this scenario, we created a custom
' helper class exposing the CommitHelper.CommitOnValueChanged attached
' property.
' 
' This example uses the same idea as the one demonstrated in the
' http://www.devexpress.com/scid=E1801 thread. If you don't want to use custom
' helpers, check the solution from the E1801 example instead.
